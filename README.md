# 10 Years Later Occupations and Professions
A Work-In-Progress Project Zomboid mod for occupations that replace the vanilla professions for ones that are more 10 years later friendly.

Planned Features:
* More Professions;
  * Redesigning professions to fit a specific playstyle (eg. Wanderers being claustrophobic to encourage wilderness play.)
  * Faction based professions, such as Bandits and Heroes
* Balancing trait points, experience, etc
* More clothing options for players.

In Consideration:
* Compatability with More Traits mod.
* Items on Spawn (Create this as a seperate mod that can be enabled with this one)

How to install:
1. Download the "10YearsLaterOccupations" folder
2. Drop into C:\Users\USERNAME\Zomboid\mods
3. Done :)
